## 1. About TomatoApp

TomatoApp is Application for Android 4+ made by me and my friend Konrad. We used scaloid library and used Scala langauge. This app is about PomodoroTechnique which is a time management method. More about it here: [Click]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

## 2. Functions

Then we can check our login name if we forget it just now ;) Also we can check amount of our pomodoros or tomatos (I prefer tomatos), the last tomato and the list all of them with dates.
