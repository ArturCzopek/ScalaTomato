## 1. About TomatoApp

TomatoApp is Application for Android 4+ made by me and my friend Konrad. We used scaloid library and used Scala langauge. This app is about PomodoroTechnique which is a time management method. More about it here: [Click]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

## 2. Functions

In this app everyone has own local database in which are users tomatoes! Firstly of course, we should create account...:)

![Register](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArturCzopek/ScalaTomato/master/screenshots/Register2.png)


Then we can check our login name if we forget it just now ;) Also we can check amount of our pomodoros or tomatos (I prefer tomatos), the last tomato and the list all of them with dates.

Finally, we can start our own tomato and show how much we have today :) Later, you will hear a sound. Congratulations, you have your own first tomato ;)

## 3. Difference between .scala and .java with .xml.

 For example, I will show you code of LoginActivity class with view. Code [here](https://github.com/ArturCzopek/ScalaTomato/blob/master/src/main/java/czopekonieszczuk/scalatomato/activities/LoginActivity.scala) is pretty much the same like these [two](https://github.com/ArturCzopek/ScalaTomato/tree/master/src/main/java/czopekonieszczuk/scalatomato/javaandxml). You can decide which method is better :)
